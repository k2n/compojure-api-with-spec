# compojure-api-with-spec

## Pre-requisites
* Java 8
* [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org)

## Usage

```bash
lein ring server
```

## Deploy 

```bash
lein uberjar
java -jar target/server.jar
```

`test-refresh` lein plugin is handy if you want to make changes as it re-executes tests affected by the updated code.
```bash

lein test-refresh
```

See how it works from command line with [HTTPie](https:httpie.org).  
```bash
./http_tests
```
